        <h3>Introduction</h3>

          <p>Welcome to ASEIS, the Analysis and Simulation of Earthquake Impacts Laboratory in the <a href="http://www.ceri.memphis.edu" target="_blank">Center for Earthquake Research and Information</a> (CERI) and the <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/ce/" target="_blank">Department of Civil Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.memphis.edu" target="_blank">University of Memphis</a>. ASEIS is an effort led by Prof. Ricardo Taborda in collaboration with other researchers at CERI and in partnership with scientists affiliated with the <a href="http://www.scec.org" target="_blank">Southern California Earthquake Center</a> (SCEC).</p>
          
          <p>At ASEIS, we are interested in studying the response of the ground motion during strong earthquakes and their effects on urban infrastructure, thorugh analysis and simulation. We use data from past events and numerical methods to understand and model multi-scale earthquake systems in and end-to-end approach, from the source to the response of structures such as buildings. In particular, we employ signal processing techniques to analyze data and finite element methods to solve forward wave-propagation problems at local and regional scales. We perform simulations using high-performance (parallel) computing applications developed for reproducing realistic ground-motion wavefields in highly heterogeneous crustal structures that include soft sedimentary deposits; and real data recorded during earthquakes for verification and validation. The comparisons between results from simulations and data are used to improve our modeling approaches and understand how the ground motion characteristics are shaped by source, path, and site effects. We also consider models that incorporate the presence of the built environment. We couple simplified engineering models of structures witht ground motion simulations in order to understand the interactions that exist between the behavior of buildings during strong shaking and the ground motion. We are interested in both individual soil-structure and collective site-city interaction effects. Ultimately, we seek to predict the impact of earthquakes in urban regions near active seismic zones to prevent or reduce the socio-economical effects of natural disasters.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
