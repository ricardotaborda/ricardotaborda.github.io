        <h3>Welcome to ASEIS</h3>

          <p>Welcome the <strong>Analysis and Simulation of Earthquake Impacts (ASEIS)</strong> research group at the <a href="http://www.memphis.edu" target="_blank">University of Memphis</a>.</p>

          <p>Our research group is interested in studying the response of the ground motion during strong earthquakes and their effects on urban infrastructure through data analysis and simulation. At ASEIS, we use observations from past events and numerical methods to understand and model earthquake phenomena in and end-to-end approach, from the earthquake source to the response of infrastructure systems. We have a particular interest in advancing the field of physics-based (deterministic) earthquake ground motion simulation for its use in engineering problems.</p>

          <p>ASEIS is part of the <a href="http://www.ceri.memphis.edu" target="_blank">Center for Earthquake Research and Information</a> (CERI) and the <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/ce/" target="_blank">Department of Civil Engineering</a> at University of Memphis. Our team, led by <a href="http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/people/rtbrdros/">Prof. Ricardo Taborda</a>, includes graduate students in the programs of geophysics and engineering seismology at CERI and Civil Engineering, respectively, and undergraduate students in Computer Science.</p>

          In particular, we employ signal processing techniques to analyze data, and finite element methods to solve forward wave-propagation problems at local and regional scales. We perform simulations using high-performance (parallel) computer applications developed for reproducing realistic ground-motion wavefields in highly heterogeneous crustal structures that include soft sedimentary deposits; and real data recorded during earthquakes for verification and validation. The comparisons between results from simulations and data are used to improve our modeling approaches and understand how the ground motion characteristics are shaped by source, path, and site effects. We also consider models that incorporate the presence of the built environment. We couple simplified engineering models of structures with ground motion simulations in order to understand the interactions that exist between the behavior of buildings during strong shaking and the ground motion. We are interested in both individual soil-structure and collective site-city interaction effects. Ultimately, we seek to predict the impact of earthquakes in urban regions near active seismic zones to prevent or reduce the socio-economical effects of natural disasters.</p>

          , in partnership with other UM faculty, and in collaboration with with scientists affiliated with the <a href="http://www.scec.org" target="_blank">Southern California Earthquake Center</a> (SCEC). Within SCEC, our activities are primarily associated with projects and research initiatives carried out by the SCEC <a href="http://scec.usc.edu/scecpedia/CME">Community Modeling Environemnt Group</a>.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
